# Heat_Disease_Prediction

###Brief Project Description
This heart disease prediction project is a small application of mathematics such as statistic and discrete maths as built-in function in Python and combine with a dataset that contains thousands rows of unidentifiable patients' data, including those with and without the heart disease, to train machine learning and predict whether they are at 10 years risks of chronic heart disease. This simplistic and rough edge project is targeted for anyone who is interested in finding out whether they are in risk of the heart disease or not, though, the requirement of the attributes may be a restriction as some medical checkup is needed to know the exact number such as heart rate, cholesterol level, glucose level, systolic blood pressure level, and diastolic blood pressure level.
